          Looking to transition from IT support and networking into full-stack web development. My background is quite varied and I've taken quite the circuitous road to get here. I grew up in Big Spring Texas and was active in bands and many academic events. I competed at the state level in both musical performance, where I played the trombone, and at multiple mathematics events. I decided to go to Texas Christian University and pursue a music degree. Shortly after arriving I changed degrees to Math and pursued a career as a high school math teacher. Due to financial reasons I ended up leaving the education field and bounced around different careers until I wound up falling into IT.

          My first foray was leaving my profession in insurance sales at the time and starting a business to mine cryptocurrency. I ended up expanding the venture, added in business partners, and continued to research market trends and price hardware. I was responsible for building and maintaining the mining rigs. This involved sourcing hardware, building and configuring the computers, coming up with maintenance schedules and handling the software side. I configured the entire endeavour that I could run the machines remotely from my cell phone, and the mined currency would transfer immediately to a centralized wallet we had set up. Unfortunately the whole industry took a turn for the worse in 2018 and our enterprise ended up costing more in electricity costs than was actually earning. We decided to close down the business, but Iâ€™d enjoyed my foray into IT so much I decided to pursue a career in it. My first job was in Geek Squad for Best Buy, then I got a job as a IT Support Specialist for Wilmington Health, eventually being promoted to a senior position.
