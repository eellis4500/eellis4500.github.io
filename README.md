#INTO THE UNKNOWN - horiseon.com

##Requirements
A codebase that follows accessibility standards so that our own site is optimized for search engines.

##Motivation
I've reworked alot of the elements in the code to fit the storyboard provided by marketing of what the site should look like. Additionally I've left detailed notes about my changes, and have simplified the code in quite a few areas for others to see and more easily edit in the future.

As a side note, this is my first professional project, and I have thoroughly enjoyed working with the horiseon team and helping their site better fit their companie's goals.

Below are images of the asked for site in comparison to my completed version. Mine is the image on the right.

Significant time was spent simplifying the code in order to allow single classes of css to have maximum effect. I've also reordered much of the css code to better match the flow of the document.
